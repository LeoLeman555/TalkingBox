# Talking Box

This project is developed within the Make:able Challenge, which focuses on designing and building assistive technologies that improve daily life and autonomy for people with disabilities, using a user-centered and ethical design approach.

This application allows a responsible adult to configure scheduled voice reminders and send them to an autonomous ESP32-based device designed to support time awareness and daily routines for people with cognitive disabilities.

## Overview

The application enables:

- Text-based message creation
- Offline text-to-speech (TTS) generation into MP3 files
- Reliable Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transfer to an ESP32 device
- Scheduling and persistence of voice reminders
- Clear device status feedback for configuration and debugging

The system is designed to work fully offline, without cloud services, ensuring privacy and reliability.

## Technology Stack

- **React Native** (no Expo)
- **Android Native Module** (TextToSpeech → MP3)
- **Bluetooth Low Energy**: `react-native-ble-plx`

## Prerequisites

- Git ≥ 2.30
- Node.js ≥ 18
- npm
- Android Studio with Android SDK
- Physical Android device (required for BLE testing)
